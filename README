Since this project is just my personal playground, please don't expect perfection. 

If using accumulo-1.3.5 or the 1.4 branch, use the command "mvn package && mvn assembly:single" to build it as per the README. If using trunk, you just need to run mvn package to build it.

Consider adding something like "git checkout 1.4" or "git checkout 1.3.5" after you "cd accumulo". The x.y.z tags are very stable (they correspond to releases), the x.y tags are increasingly stable over time, and trunk may be disrupted at any time.
